#Distributed Hash Table with BTree Storage
##Overview
This project implements a primitive InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using a Ring Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and B-trees for storing data. It demonstrates concepts of distributed systems, hashing, and efficient data storage and retrieval.

#Features
Ring DHT: Implements a circular DHT where nodes are organized in a ring structure.
Finger Tables: Each node maintains a finger table to quickly locate other nodes in the DHT.
BTree Storage: Data is stored in B-trees associated with each node, enabling efficient storage and retrieval.
SHA-1 Hashing: Uses SHA-1 hashing to generate unique IDs for files and nodes.
Quadratic Probing: Handles collisions using quadratic probing for ID assignment.
Routing: Efficient routing and lookup using the finger table.
